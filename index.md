I am Entong He. I am a final-year undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in computer science. During my previous years I was very fortunate to work with Prof. [Daniel Zhuoyu Long](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~zylong/) (SEEM) at CUHK; Prof. [Chenshu Wu](https://cswu.me/) (AIoT Lab) and Prof. [Yuxiang Yang](https://yangyx09.github.io/) (QICI) at HKU; Prof. [Anne Broadbent](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/abroadbe/) and Dr. [Connor Paddock](https://www.connorpaddock.page/) (QUASAR) at uOttawa.

## (Research) Interests

- **Quantum Information:** quantum tomography, quantum complexity theory (recently introduced to this field).
- **Networking:** sensor network localization.

## News
- **[Mar. 2025]** I am joining [QICI](https://qici.weebly.com/), HKU CDS as a PhD student in Fall 2025. I will be working with Prof. [Yuxiang Yang](https://yangyx09.github.io/).
- **[May. - Aug. 2024]** I joined uOttawa [QUASAR](https://quasarlab.org/) group as a Mitacs GRI 2024 research intern.

## CV of Failure 
Although my life has witnessed minor events of success, failure is inevitably the major theme of it. In the private discussion with my college mate Shunzhuang Huang (also a high school upperclassman, now a PhD candidate @ UChicago Booth), I realized that it is rather significant to memorize these failures so as not to be scammed by some insignificant success. Hope that this rapidly-growing document will be a kick on my backside. \
See **[CV of Failure](assets/files/Failure_CV.pdf)** for details.
